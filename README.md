# Offensive Wireless & RF Lab

This project tracks my offensive wireless security research and tooling. It starts with Wi-Fi WPA2 cracking, and will expand into BLE reconnaissance and SDR signal manipulation.

## Focus Areas

-  Wi-Fi WPA2 handshake capture and cracking
-  Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) sniffing and spoofing
-  Software Defined Radio (SDR) signal analysis and replay

## Current Tooling

- `wifi_crack_helper.sh`: WPA2 cracking helper using aircrack-ng
- `rf_learning.md`: Full learning roadmap and attack strategy
- `HARDWARE.md`: Required devices for full execution

## Status

Initial scripts written. Tooling and attack methods planned. RF and BLE testing to begin after hardware acquisition.

> This repo is foundational to expanding my red team operations into physical-layer attack surfaces.
